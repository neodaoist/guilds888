# The Background

- Sibiu, Romania was founded by Saxon settlers during the mid-late 12th century
- By the 14th century it was already an important trade center, with craftspeople divided into  various guilds
- This piece is inspired by that rich history, employing a musical language to evoke the essence of each guild
- While the digital guilds of tomorrow may be frontend and contracts, growth and community ‚Äî¬†craftsmanship will always matter

# The Music

- There are 8 GUILDS, each represented musically, from Blacksmiths to Candlemakers, Glassblowers, and more
- The total piece is 8 movements, ~12 min long, for flute, bassoon, violin, viola, and mixed percussion
- Music by Neodaoist; for full score and/or parts, contact [@neodaoist](https://twitter.com/neodaoist)
