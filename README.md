# The Background

- Sibiu was founded in Transilvania by Saxon settlers, during the mid‚Äìlate 12th century
- By the 14th century it was already an important trade center, with craftspeople divided into 40 guilds
- Like other Transilvanian cities then, the citadel walls were lined with towers, each maintained by a guild
- This piece is inspired by that rich history, employing a musical language to evoke the essence of each guild
- While the guilds of tomorrow may be Frontend or Contracts, Growth or Community, Data or Deep Learning ‚Äî¬†craftsmanship will always matter

# The Music

- There are 8 GUILDS, each represented musically, from Blacksmiths to Candlemakers, Glassblowers, and more
- The piece is 8 movements, ~12 minutes long, for flute, bassoon, violin, viola, and mixed percussion
- In the [full version](https://gallery.manifold.xyz/base/0x4db3ab8e606eadf3d94cf5349a35c415156b89b3/1), between movements there is a "promenade" motif on tubular bells, spelling out SI-B-I-U (this idea came to my composition teacher in a dream ‚ú®)

# The Art

- There are 8 art STYLES, from Cave Art to Solarpunk, Starry Night to Psychedelia
- There are 64 audio-emotional moments (8 guilds x 8 styles)
- Each an edition of 8, for a total of 512 moments (8x8x8)
- How can collectors MELT their common moment NFTs into rarer NFTs?
  - A collector with all 8 style moments of a guild, can MELT into an [uncommon 1x8 GUILD moment strip](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xe09cd75b2e3a874f08fb8d09a98bdea307a1ff92/73)
  - A collector with all 8 guild moments of a style, can MELT into an [uncommon 8x1 STYLE moment strip](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xe09cd75b2e3a874f08fb8d09a98bdea307a1ff92/66)
  - A collector with all 64 audio-emotional moments, can MELT into a [rare 8x8 MOSAIC moment sheet](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xe09cd75b2e3a874f08fb8d09a98bdea307a1ff92/81)
  - A collector with all 512 audio-emotional moments, can MELT into the [1/1 ultrarare 8x8x8 CUBE](https://gallery.manifold.xyz/base/0x4db3ab8e606eadf3d94cf5349a35c415156b89b3/1)
- 2D art prompted by Neodaoist; 3D art modeled by digital collaborator (literally paid with OP airdrop earnings!)

## The Experience

1. [x] Deploy the contract and MINT the 8x8x8 CUBE with [Manifold](https://gallery.manifold.xyz/base/0x4db3ab8e606eadf3d94cf5349a35c415156b89b3/1)
2. [x] UNMELT the CUBE into [512 audio-emotional moments](https://basescan.org/tx/0x01a9df31ac13b0317af88fb403ea94940b0d2d2f951dca3d65633c781c5a37c1)
3. [x] MELT a few moment strips and mosaics ([scroll to bottom to see rares =)](https://zora.co/0x4ab68ce2dd8dbdd17f925b5ab49e6f7ad433013b))
4. [x] List the remaining moments [for sale for .000888 ETH!](https://opensea.io/collection/guilds888)
5. [ ] Enjoy the MUSIC and ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• MELT ü´†

## What's Next for GUILDS?

- The Music ‚Äî¬†üéª Would love to re-record the expanded version, again with [ICon Arts Ensemble](https://iconartsfestival.com/)
- The Code ‚Äî¬†‚õΩÔ∏è Definitely some opportunities to gas golf and optimize the contract further
- The Art ‚Äî¬†‚è≥ Could add a time dimension, where the art unfolds and evolves over time
- The Experience ‚Äî¬†üíª Develop a frontend, because right now melting is done by interacting directly with the contract, eg using [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/), [op-viem](https://www.opviem.sh/), or [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/)
